### **üëã Hey, I'm Chaitri**

I'm an undergraduate Data Science & Economics student who's passionate about builing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, empower communities and drive impact through data. I'm deeply interested in the applications of machine learning, deep learning, and predictive modeling.

#### üéØ Current Focus
Right now, I'm working on real-world ML and analytics projects to grow my portfolio, deepening my skills, exploring tools all while on the lookout for opportunities in ML and Data Science.

#### üß† Skills & Tools
- **Skills:** Python, SQL, C++, STATA, Octave, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, Time Series Forecasting, Data Analysis & Visualisation
- **Tools:** MySQL, Hadoop, Docker, AWS, Power BI, Amazon QuickSight, MS Office, GSuite

#### üöÄ Projects
- **Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification:**
  Built a CNN using Pytorch to classify malignant vs benign tissue samples from histopatological images. Experimented with CNN architectures including EfficientNet, ResNet, as well as Vision Transformers (ViT) to benchmark performance. Applied data preprocessing, augmentation, and early stopping for model robustness, achieving over 90% validation accuracy. This project was presented at a conference on AI in Healthcare to a group of medical professionals.

- **Stroke Prediction from EHR Data:**
  Developed a classification model to predict stroke risk using a range of clinical and lifestyle factors from electronic health records. Employed feature engineering, addressed class imbalance, and evaluated the model using ROC-AUC and stratified cross-validation to ensure generalizability and fairness.

- **Stock Price Forecasting using SARIMAX:**
  Built time series forecasting models to predict stock movements using SARIMAX architectures. Conducted stationarity testing, AIC/BIC-based model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize forecasting performance. Compared the effectiveness of classical statistical methods and deep learning-based approaches for modeling non-linear trends.

- **Classification of Devanagari Characters:**
  Explored image classification techniques on the Devanagari handwritten character dataset. Applied classical machine learning models like KNN, decision trees, and random forests, and built a CNN to benchmark against deep learning performance. Focused on improving accuracy through preprocessing and architecture tuning.

- **Irrigation Water Optimization:**
  Implemented mathematical optimization techniques such as gradient descent, steepest descent, and golden section search to optimize irrigation scheduling. Used real-world agricultural data including daily measurements of evapotranspiration, solar radiation, soil and air temperature to inform decisions. Project demonstrated efficient water usage under varying environmental conditions.

- **Wildfire Risk & Property Values in the U.S:**
  Analyzed the impact of wildfire risk on residential property values using OLS regression with robust standard errors. Introduced interaction terms to study whether neighborhood quality moderates the negative effect of wildfire exposure. Found that higher wildfire risk reduces property values, but neighborhoods with higher quality mitigate this impact significantly.

- **NBA Statistics Analysis (C++):**
  Performed statistical analysis on NBA player performance metrics using C++. Designed a custom data pipeline to clean, store, sort, and evaluate player statistics for insights on efficiency and performance trends. This project emphasized algorithmic thinking, memory efficiency, and hands-on use of data structures and sorting algorithms.

- **Python Data Visualization:**
  Created interactive and static data visualizations using Dash, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. Built dashboards and visual storytelling experiences that communicated key insights from complex datasets in a clear, engaging manner.
